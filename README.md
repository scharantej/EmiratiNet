### Routes

### Additional Considerations

- The templates for HTML files should be placed in the templates folder within the Flask application directory.
- The routes should be defined in the application's primary Python script, using the @app.route decorator.
- The application's static files, including images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript scripts, should be organized in dedicated folders within the Flask app's directory structure.
- For user authentication and session management, Flask-Login or a similar Flask extension can be integrated.
- To ensure the application's security, implement necessary precautions against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
